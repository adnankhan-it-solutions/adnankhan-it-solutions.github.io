      <!-- BACKGROUND -->
      <section>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          My journey is driven by a deep curiosity about how systems work —
          technical, organizational, and human-centered. Over time, this
          curiosity evolved into a structured approach to problem solving,
          combining research-driven thinking with practical implementation.

      <!-- ACADEMIA & RESEARCH -->
      <section>
        <h2>Academia & Research</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently a PhD scholar at Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU),
          Qatar, where my work focuses on research-informed system design,
          data-driven analysis, and applied intelligence. My academic background
          includes peer-reviewed research publications and supervision of
          technical and research-based projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          My research interests lie at the intersection of systems engineering,
          data analytics, intelligent systems, and real-world problem modeling.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE -->
      <section>
        <h2>Industry Experience</h2>
        <p>
          Alongside academia, I have gained hands-on industry experience in
          engineering and applied technology environments. This includes work
          in telecommunications and system laboratories, where I contributed to
          system testing, instrumentation, troubleshooting, and deployment.
        </p>
        <p>
          This exposure allows me to bridge theory and practice — designing
          solutions that are not only technically sound but also deployable
          and scalable.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- LEADERSHIP & MENTORSHIP -->
      <section>
        <h2>Leadership & Mentorship</h2>
        <p>
          I have held leadership and mentoring roles across academic and
          technical environments, including laboratory engineering positions
          and student-led initiatives. I have supervised and guided numerous
          student projects, supported curriculum development, and contributed
          to outcome-based education initiatives.
        </p>

      <!-- INNOVATION & ENTREPRENEURSHIP -->
      <section>
        <h2>Innovation & Entrepreneurship</h2>
        <p>
          I am actively involved in innovation and venture-building initiatives.
          I am the founder of <strong>MotionID</strong>, a technology venture
          focused on developing intelligent, real-world solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have also been selected as an <strong>Incubatee at Qatar Science &
          Technology Park (QSTP)</strong>, further strengthening my engagement
          with applied innovation, entrepreneurship, and industry collaboration.
        </p>

      <!-- FORWARD LOOKING -->
      <section>
        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <p>
          My focus moving forward is on building impactful systems at the
          intersection of research, technology, and real-world needs — through
          IT solutions, innovation-driven projects, and collaborative ventures.
